# Building Modern Web Apps with Next.js

Next.js has revolutionized how we build React applications. Let's explore some of its key features.

## App Router

The new App Router in Next.js 13+ provides:

1. **File-based routing** - Organize your routes with folders
2. **Server Components** - Better performance by default
3. **Streaming** - Progressive page loading

## Key Benefits

### Performance
- Automatic code splitting
- Image optimization
- Built-in caching strategies

### Developer Experience
- Hot reloading
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Excellent debugging tools

## Example: Server Component

\`\`\`tsx
// app/posts/page.tsx
export default async function PostsPage() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts(); // This runs on the server
  
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

Next.js continues to evolve, making it easier than ever to build fast, modern web applications.
