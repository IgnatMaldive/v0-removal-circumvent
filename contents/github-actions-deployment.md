# Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions makes it incredibly easy to automate your deployment workflow. Here's how I set up automatic deployment for this blog.

## The Workflow

Every time I push a new markdown file to the `contents/` directory, GitHub Actions:

1. **Detects the change** in the repository
2. **Builds the Next.js application**
3. **Deploys to production** automatically

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Content Creation
- Write posts in Markdown
- Commit and push to trigger deployment
- No manual build or deployment steps

### For Maintenance
- Version control for all content
- Easy rollbacks if needed
- Collaborative editing through pull requests

## The GitHub Action Workflow

\`\`\`yaml
name: Deploy Blog
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['contents/**']

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        run: # Your deployment command
\`\`\`

This setup transforms content creation into a seamless, automated process!

Now let's create the utility functions to read and process the markdown files:
